# Manual APWorld for Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!

## What's this?
This is a Manual APWorld, functional with the [Archipelago Randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/) system. This project specifically is a world containing the randomization game-rules for Cook, Serve, Delicious 3.

## What do I need to play?
All you need is the CSD3 save that's bundled with the APWorld.

## How does it work?
**Victory condition**: get a silver medal on the final level of the Iron Cook Speedway, Champion Cup 3.

**Locations**: All areas in the game have 3 specific levels with 2 checks each (bronze and silver medal).

You start with only one area unlocked, the Buttermilk County, with most of the foods unlocked but no upgrades and the subsequent areas locked.
Unlocking the next area is done by beating the exit level of the previous area and having an Entrance Permit item, with the requirement increasing by one for each subsequent area. 
Unlocking an area unlocks the 3 levels in that area.
Example:
- To unlock the second area, Evergreen Meadows, get a bronze on Buttermilk County exit level and have 1 Entrance Permit item.
- To unlock the third area, Halcyon County, get a bronze on Evergreen Meadows exit level and have 2 Entrance Permit items.
- To unlock the fourth area, Tyrell County, get a bronze on Halcyon County exit level and have 3 Entrance Permit items.
- And so on...

For easier in-game tracking, in the save, all levels available in the world have no medal. Levels that are out-of-scope all have golden medals.

This APWorld was made with Standard Mode in mind, but Chill Mode should work too.

### Foods
Most of the foods are unlocked by default, but some are locked behind items. Those foods are:

#### 5 point
- Bibimbap
- Calzone
- Creme Brulee
- Pizza
- Tamales
- Wok Dish: Beef/Pork
- Wok Dish: Chicken
- Wok Dish: Shrimp/Veg
#### 4 point
- Beef Wellington
- Gazpacho
#### 3 point
- Food Truck Fries
- Ratatouille
- Steak
#### 1 point
- Brisket Slices
- Ham Slices
- Turkey Slices

For easier in-game tracking, locked foods are unpurchased in the save. Once you get the item corresponding to the food, you can purchase it from the catalog.

### Truck Upgrades
You start the run with no upgrades, but the save comes with all upgrades purchased at lvl 1.

**Disable all upgrades before starting a run! The game re-enables upgrades on save load if they are not fully upgraded.**

Once you obtain the item corresponding to an upgrade, you can enable it from the truck upgrades menu.  
For upgrades that have multiple levels (like Heat Lamps), each copy allows you to increase that upgrade's level by 1. So if you have 2 Heat Lamps, you can upgrade it to lvl 2. **You can't lower the upgrade's level once it's purchased. If you make a mistake, ALT+F4 so the game doesn't save your purchase.** 
The save comes with 100 upgrade materials, so you can purchase upgrades as soon as you get the items.

### Traps
There are 4 trap items in the world - Mandatory Extra Prep Station.
For each mandatory prep station you have, you must permamently enable an extra prep station in the truck upgrades menu.
If you don't have enough prep stations to fill all the traps, just fill them as soon as you obtain the prep stations.
